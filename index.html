  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web-security-question">
    How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
 
 
  <p id="web-security-answer">
    Depending on the client’s needs, experience and knowledge. When selecting web hosting services I would make a smaller presentation going over common threats and which counter-measures are included with different providers. 
    Since the biggest risk is human error I would also provide information on basic do’s and don’ts: don’t open email attachments without caution, don’t open hyperlinks without verifying their destination, encourage proper password management, etc. 
    This is extra important for the people managing the site on the client’s side, and reminders are valuable even for the tech savvy. Implementing other protocols like login timeouts, two-factor authentication etc. are also important tools to limiting risk
    from human error.
